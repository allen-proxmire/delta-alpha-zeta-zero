# From Alpha to Zeta: A Geometric Transformation Linking Primes and Zeta Zeros

## Overview

This research note introduces a geometric and analytic framework connecting the distribution of prime numbers to the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta Function. The work defines the **Δα Signal**, derived from the angular geometry of consecutive primes, and demonstrates its equivalence to the derivative of the normalized prime gap.

Spectral analysis of the Δα Signal reveals three invariant frequencies — 0.35153, 0.38895, and 0.47871 — which correspond precisely to the “beat frequencies” between low-order imaginary Zeta zeros when scaled by a single constant, **c ≈ 0.088128**.

This establishes a direct, one-to-one mapping between geometric patterns in the prime sequence and the analytic structure of the Zeta function, offering a new empirical pathway toward understanding the prime–Zeta connection.
